Hi ðŸ‘‹  
  
I'm Kevin, a developer and entrepreneur who loves building user-friendly apps. Without any certifications, I started to work in web development since my 16 years, creating web pages for hobbies. Later I quit school to start working as a self taught freelance. I mostly work as an agency for small companies who need websites for their own business.  
  
At some point, because I love networking, I landed into an event where I met lots of entrepreneurs who need developers for their startups. From there I start my journey in my first freelance full time position as a frontend developer.  
The startup was [Fishtripr](https://www.fishtripr.com/), a travel-tech startup who helped people to connect to nature by fishing. I grew there as full-stack dev then as lead frontend developer.  
  
The startup kind of died, but gave me an amazing experience and network in that world. Then I joined [Wooclap](https://www.wooclap.com/), an edtech startup this time, with a bigger, impactful mission. The goal is to help presenters to have more interactions with their audience, but specialise into education for teachers and students.  
  
All along the way I kept working on side projects for hobbies and learning purposes. One of the best projects I work on is HackYourFuture Belgium which is a coding school for refugees.
